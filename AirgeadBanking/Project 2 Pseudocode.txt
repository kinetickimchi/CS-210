Display interface for “Data Input”
	Prompt user for initial investment amount
	Prompt user for monthly deposit
	Prompt user for annual interest rate (compounded)
	Prompt user for number of years investment has to grow

Calculate monthly interest rate:
	monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 12 / 100

Calculate total number of months:
	totalMonths = numYears * 12

Get (any key) input from user to continue

Loop to calculate figures for report 1 (without monthly deposits) from 1 to numYears:
	Calculate totalAnnualInterest = initialInvestment * monthlyInterestRate
	Calculate yearEndBalance = initialInvestment + totalAnnualInterest

Display report 1 in row/column format. Each row contains year, year end balance, and year end earned interest.

Loop to calculate figures for report 2 (with monthly deposits) from 1 to numYears:
	Set currentTotal to initialInvestment
	Loop for each month (1 - 12):
		Calculate monthlyInterest = currentTotal * monthlyInterestRate
		Calculate monthly end balance = currentTotal + monthlyDeposit + monthlyInterest

Display report 2 in row/column format. Each row contains year, year end balance, and year end earned interest.

Ask user if they would like to start over (y/n)
